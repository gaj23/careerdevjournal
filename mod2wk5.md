# Mod 2 Week 5

### Review your habit tracker:
1. How did you monitor your habit(s)? What does this tell you about your overall progress becoming the person you want to be?
> I monitored my habits of getting off the pc by 9 and completing prework for the week on Sunday by asking myself the questions: How did I feel when I was able to get off the pc by pc? Was I able to do yoga the next morning or did I decide to sleep in, instead? How did I feel when I completed Sunday prework? Did I feel stressed about school while I was on the slopes? Asking myself these questions shows me that what's most important to me is keeping the promises I made to myself. On days I didn't get off at 9, I knew that I wouldn't be able to stick to my schedule of waking up and doing yoga or having an quiet extra half hour in the morning to enjoy. I shows me that I'm my biggest motivator. Having my partner heckle me (lovingly) when I'm still typing at 8:59 was helpful, buttttt I felt more satisfied when I was able to do it on my own. I think that reveals my independent and self reliant disposition.

2. In general, how satisfied are you with how you spent your time this module? What could be improved next module?
> I'm proud of the work I've done. By maintaining a healthy sleeping, eating, and physical exercise schedule, it's improved my focus and ability to be more efficient in my work and the time that I have. There are points, though, where I put those aside because I felt I needed to keep pushing and pushing, which resulted poor mental health, lots of crying, and feeling dejected. If I can keep improving how I take care of my physical health, I know my mental health will remain stable which will result in quality work.

### Mind Maps:

1. Engagement. What did you reflect on last week in regards to when you’re engaged in your work at Turing? Pull out an idea that resonates with you most (e.g., “Talking through a problem with a partner,” “The moment when I solve a problem that I previously didn’t know how to do,” “Setting up a successful project management process for my team”) and break that idea down into parts and make a list (what are all the steps that go into that moment? When do you get to use your strengths? What is fun about this?).

> Learning about scss & organization; talking about and reflecting when we would apply a possibly beneficial tool.
  - I get to ask questions
  - provide answers & information
  - discuss strategies

2. Energy. What did you reflect on last week in regards to when you feel most energized in your work at Turing? Pull out an idea that resonates with you most and break that idea down into parts and make a list (what are all the steps that go into that moment? When do you get to use your strengths? What is fun about this?).

> At the start of our project, I liked the discussion around how we wanted to approach this project and where we saw it going.
 - this allows me to feel motivated
 - micro tasks that are achievable, but with a direction in mind
 - prevented the scaries of having a big project ahead of use

3. Flow. When have you had an experience recently in which you were in a state of flow? You can also think about this as “joy” or “play.” Pull out an idea that resonates with you most and break that idea down into parts and make a list (what are all the steps that go into that moment? When do you get to use your strengths? What is fun about this?).

> When I had a time constraint to get a certain task done
  - I was able to focus
  - I knew that this is all the time I had
  - made me reach for my tools faster rather than just looking at the screen

##### Prototype your mind maps:

> What do these mind maps tell you about what’s important to you as a software developer? What questions do they bring up about what you still want to learn about this career?

- For me, it's important to have space to explore and try new things. I feel motivated when there's an outline of a plan and honest discussion about goals and I'd rather have specific periods to get done small tasks than a big task over a long period of time. I know this is what I prefer and I would like to hear from other devs whether or not this is their experience in the field.

##### Prototype your outreach:

> Who comes to mind as a person you can reach out to? Why that person? What questions would you ask them? Come up with 2-3 people here to serve as prototypes
How would this outreach help you further your job search strategy?

Josh. He's my sister's partner and the first person I went to when I was thinking about going into software development. He has a BS and Masters in CS, but takes bootcamp grads seriously. I've asked him questions about norms in the field and types of working environments. Now I have more specifics of what it's like to be a dev, also asking about expectations and how to go into a technical interview is where I want to take our conversations next. This outreach allows me to be exposed as many working environments as possible so that I can be aware of what environment I want to be in or advocate for once I have a job. Additional prototypes would be my mentors: Casey Dallavalle and Jeannie Evans.


##### Outreach & Networking Plan:

Based on your reflections above, create a concrete plan for your outreach:

1. Who is the right person for you to reach out to?  

I would like to reach out to Josh, my sister's partner. He's been a dev at a start up for the last 5 years. He's "classically" trained, but has hired people who took bootcamps and was the one who got me in contact with Turing alumni originally. Additionally, I know I can reach out to both of my mentors, too.

2. How will you find them? How do you know they’re the right person?

I know my mentors are the right people because both of them are very good about "remember, in the real world" conversations. They both have different experiences in regards to finding a job and the paths they took. I know Josh is the right person, too, because he's expressed his excitement and willingness to help me.

3. How will you reach out?

Slack and email that will hopefully lead to an actual conversation.

4. What questions do you need to ask them?

- What were some of the first steps you took as you began the job search?
- What did you find helpful? What did you find unhelpful?
- Do you have examples of tech challenges that you struggled with and how did you handle them?

5. How will you use this information to further your solution?

- Are there actions they took that I haven't yet and would those actions be beneficial for me?
- Based on their suggestions for tech challenges, I would assess those suggestions and focus on the ones that overlap.

6. How will you follow up?

- Email follow up of "Thank you for your suggestions. I found X helpful. I learned about Y. I currently doing Z"


###### Execute your plan:

Reach out to your contact THIS WEEK. If possible, reach out to more than one person OR find a meetup to attend also.

1. What happened?

- I ended up attending an event with OutInTech! I spoke with a mixed bag of people about what to expect. Some of them work with devs, some of those people work as devs. Having both of those povs was great.

2. What other next steps should you take? If this is a person connected to a company you’re interested in, be sure to add it to your Huntr card.

- I think exploring places that I want to work for and if those places have any recruiters/sources or job opening, start creating a line of communication that way.
