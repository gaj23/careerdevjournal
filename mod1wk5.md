# Mod 1 Week 5

## Habits Reflection:
- How have you seen yourself become more aware of your habits? Have you tried implementing anything new? What have the results been?
> I became more aware of my habits when I started asking my partner to keep me accountable. He would call to see if I'm off the computer and then because I wasn't, he would have to wait for me to stop & shut down. I've experienced some backsliding with the group projects, though, as I'm trying to be more aware of the timezone difference between us. But by diving up workload and relying heavily on good communication and the gitworkflow, I've been getting to bed at a reasonable hour.

##Design Thinking Reflection: Cultivating Beginner’s Mind
- How can beginner’s mind be helpful when it comes to thinking about your career and job search? What are some habits you could put into place to cultivate beginner’s mind regularly?
> Ask all the questions. ALL OF THEM. I think there's the constant worry about asking the "stupid" or the "simple" questions. But if I can make myself comfortable about asking where data coming from, where it's being stored, ect, then for my curious mind, it's a natural place to start. This can help me in my career and job search because it allows me to get to basics: the basics in what I want and need in a career.

- Write out your top 5 strengths that you’ve seen in action this module; then write out the strengths of a software developer. Where do you see these lists overlapping? Where are they different?
> I ask questions. I focus on the basics. I ask for help. I utilize my time wisely. I listen.
A software developer asks questions, evaluates solutions, listens to suggestions, asks for help, and manages their time.
Generally, my strengths and the strength that exist inside a software engineer are the same. The major difference is the skill of evaluating solutions. I can't look at a solution or hear a possible solution and know it will work, yet. I still have to work it out and see it before me to believe it.

- Write a refined vision statement here (what new things have you discovered this week to incorporate into your vision statement?):
> I manage a project with a team who's goal is to improve the human existence: via healthcare, civil rights, education, or environmental protection. I know if I am no longer being challenged at my position, that I can move to another or another adjacent industry to still work towards a general improvement of life on earth. To effectively to do so, though, my private boundaries must be respected so I may come back to work recharged and emotionally able to complete projects.
