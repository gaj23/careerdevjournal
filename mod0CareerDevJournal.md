1. When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?  
> Post Its. When I challenged myself to "win" [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/), my mentor for that year gave me some tips. He told me to break down the 50,000 words needed to "win" into 1,000 chunks and make a visual in whatever way worked best for me. Taking a post it, I would write a number, put it on my wall, increment it by one and loop through the process until I had reached 50. Day by day, as I would surpass those 1,000 word benchmarks, I would take down a post it, crumple it up and look at my wall of numbers and think to myself, "Yes, I am making progress even if I don't feel like my writing is going anywhere." Those visuals I created (via post its, lists in my agenda book, datapoints in excel), helped me reach my goals of becoming a Nanowrimo Winner, fluent in Japanese, and a Marathoner. They helped me maintain motivation--even if the motivation was simply crossing it off on my list or pulling it off my wall because I hate clutter. That simplest motivation is where I am starting with again as I begin my journey at Turing. That little thing of copy and pasting the questions I need to answer for my first career development journaling? Done! Look at that. I'm on a roll.
