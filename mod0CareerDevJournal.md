1. When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?  
> Post Its. When I challenged myself to "win" [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/), my mentor for that year gave me some tips. He told me to break down the 50,000 words needed to "win" into 1,000 chunks and make a visual in whatever way worked best for me. Taking a post it, I would write a number, put it on my wall, increment it by one and loop through the process until I had reached 50. Day by day, as I would surpass those 1,000 word benchmarks, I would take down a post it, crumple it up and look at my wall of numbers and think to myself, "Yes, I am making progress even if I don't feel like my writing is going anywhere." Those visuals I created (via post its, lists in my agenda book, datapoints in excel), helped me reach my goals of becoming a Nanowrimo Winner, fluent in Japanese, and a Marathoner. They helped me maintain motivation--even if the motivation was simply crossing it off on my list or pulling it off my wall because I hate clutter. That simplest motivation is where I am starting with again as I begin my journey at Turing. That little thing of copy and pasting the questions I need to answer for my first career development journaling? Done! Look at that. I'm on a roll.  

2. As you start this new career, what is one of your strengths and how do you know?  
> Perseverance. My childhood dream to travel to Japan came true! I left the United States to live in Japan without knowing where my company would place me to live and the language. But I wasn’t just visiting. I prepared to be there for at least two or more years. I knew it would be hard. I knew there would be times that I didn’t want to be doing what I was doing. That I would hate my work and maybe even want to hide in the teacher’s office rather than play with my students. Hate the fact that I missed out on all the Thanksgivings and everyone thought when I said “North Carolina” they thought I was saying “Northern California.”  

> Ok, I lied. I didn’t realize the last one would be a thing until it was. But everything else? I prepared in ways I knew worked for me: rent a larger apartment; invest in a couch; attend cooking class; pick up an instrument. That way, when those days at school when my students made me want to cry or when a Japanese coworker said something sexist, I could go home, recharge, and get back at it.  

> Or: The knowledge I have on my working strengths and preferences have been tested as a university student, working in customer service, as a waiter, and as a Japanese public school teacher. Trial and error taught me what works best for me *then*. What works for me as a software developer will also undergo some trial and error. Will waking up early rather than staying up late to work still be a viable solution for me as I begin my journey at Turing and into software development? But perhaps it is that willingness to try something I am familiar with and applying it to a different setting will be my greatest asset  
 

3. Describe how you work best (conditions, environment, preferences, etc.):  
> I do my best work without music. In a clean, organized environment with the door closed. I like having a specific start and finish time more than having accomplished tasks as my end goal. I know eating right and exercising are essential for my work. That I rather get up and leave in the middle of something I feel confident in being able to finish later rather than trying to bang out as much as possible and exhausting myself. I’m steady and maybe a bit slow considering my marathon training habits. I rather work up to something over the long run than just jumping right into it. Based on how I studied for my Japanese Language Proficiency Tests, I know that the sooner I start in the day, the better. I’m a morning worker, through and through. Afternoons are when I like to revise, edit, catch up, and prepare for the next morning.

4. As you start this new career, what is your greatest area of improvement when it comes to your professional skills?  

5. How will developing a deeper understanding of your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?
