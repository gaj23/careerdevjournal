# Mod 2 Week 4

### Prepare for Job Experience: AEIOU
1. Activities: what questions do you have about the activities that a software developer does on a daily basis?  

- On average, how many hours during a work day are your fingers on the keyboard?
- Outside of coding, what other responsibilities do devs have?

2. Environment: what questions do you have about the overall environment and culture of this workplace?  

- How has LinkedIn responded to working remote?
- Do you find your company to be active in the community?

3. Interactions: what questions do you have about the team at this company? What do you hope to learn during this experience?  

- How clear is the delineation of work responsibilities on your team?
- What was your interview process like?
- How are teams broken down? What's the hierarchy like?
- What are the team sizes?

4. Objects: what questions do you have about the code or the product?  

- How prolific is legacy code?
- When has there been a time that LinkedIn tried to implement a part of the product that the users didn't respond well to?

5. Users: what questions do you have about how the company interacts with their users?  

- How does LinkedIn decide who gets to be an influencer? Is that something that the people vet or the code does?
- What type of improvement has LinkedIn made that's based on user suggestions rather than dev driver suggestions?
- Does LinkedIn have a strong UX research team?

### After the Job Experience, reflect on the same questions; what are your takeaways from the activity?  

1. Activities: what was engaging to the person/people you met with?  

- She was engaging, thorough, and offered practical advice for the workforce.

2. Environment: what did you notice about how they talked about the culture and environment of this company?  

- She was passionate about the culture and the environment of the company.

3. Interactions: what did you notice about your interactions with this person/people?  

- She used our names and asked questions about ourselves.

4. Objects: what did you learn about their approach to code and/or product development?  

- Group projects at Turing are very different than working on teams. 

5. Users: what did you learn about their approach to their users?
What are your main takeaways from the shadow? How will you use this information to help you with your job search strategy?

- She spoke the importance of having user interviews. I really enjoyed what she had to say about if something doesn't exist in a company, to advocate for it yourself.

#### Ideas below are adapted from Atomic Habits by James Clear

- Assess your habits from week 3: how did you spend your time this past week? What was effective in your habits? What could be more effective? What steps will you take to make that happen?

> Taking the time on the weekend (Sunday) to set myself up for greatness has decreased stress and anxiety of the day to day. Additionally, it eases me into new material and makes me feel less overwhelmed. I take Sunday as a day to do scheduling set up, preteach lessons, and then set up PD for the week. Those three things and then rest... but for this month, I'll also be taking Sunday's to go snowboarding with my partner, which can/will change things.

- Implement a reinforcement strategy: to make one of your habits more satisfying, what is a reward you can give yourself immediately after completing the habit? How will this reward encourage you to continue completing that habit?

> Because I find it so helpful, I know it's important that I continue working on the above habit. Which means, *before* I get in the car to go to the mountain, I need to have those three things *done*. Which means, doing all my prep work for snowboarding the Saturday night beforehand so that Sunday am I can get up and get the work done I know that will help me in the week ahead. Thus, my reward is snowboarding & spending the day with my partner.

- What is a habit that you want to make sure to do every day? How could you visually cue yourself to complete it (i.e., moving a paper clip)? How can you visually track it each time youâ€™ve completed it? Could you automate the tracking? How will you do that?

> I want to be off the computer every day at 9. A visual cue for myself is setting an alarm with a song and by the time that song is over, my computer/work stuff is put away in a drawer out of sight. Having my partner to enforce being off the computer will be helpful as well.

- How to get back on track when missing a habit: if you miss a day or two of completing your habit, how will you get yourself going again?

> I think a good way of getting back on track with this habit will be by setting a "warning" alarm that I need to start winding down.

- Pick an accountability partner (your cohort accountabilibuddy, your mentor, a close friend, etc.) and create a habit contract with them. How often will you check in with each other? How will they hold you accountable?

> My partner will keep me accountable! He will check in every day because we live with each other. He knows I don't like to stay up late and I prefer mornings to work.
> Also, Alice, my accountabilibuddy, will check in with me during our allotted meeting time each week.
