# Mod 3 Week 1

### Refine your career vision:
> What are the values that will drive your job search?  

Does the company actively foster mentorship programs and learning space? Does the company adjust based on feedback it receives? Does the company support remote work?

> What are your goals for your job search? What kind of role do you see yourself pursuing in your job search?  

Goals include: finding a company that matches 75% of my criteria; finding a company where I match 75% of their criteria; finding a company that I feel engaged in.
I see myself looking into front end design. I enjoy working on the client side and find it rewarding. I would like to work on a team that either has UX Research or on a team that is willing to make decisions based off of UX research.

> Based on your latest version of your career vision, list the top 3-5 industries and companies youâ€™ll pursue in your job search as of right now.

- Cornell Lab of Ornithology/e-bird/Merlin
- Audobon Society
- Duolingo
- Planned Parenthood/Women's Health focused
- Terracycling/Green living focus

> Why did you pick these industries/companies? How do they relate to the values and goals you have for yourself in your job search?  

These industries reflect my passions: birds, language learning, women's health, and green living. I know that I want to work in a place where I'm surrounded by people with the same values as me. In my social media interactions, I believe these places try to foster that. Additionally, when looking into their job opening, I saw job growth and opportunities at each place. Considering this was a major factor in leaving from my last job in Japan, I know it's incredible important for myself that I don't feel pigeonholed.

### Build your resume
> What will you emphasize in your resume that directly relates to your targeted industries?

My passion & ability to work remotely despite timezone differences.

Driven to solve problems and effectively communicate.
