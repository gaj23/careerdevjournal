# Habits of a Software Developer

1. What do you think are the traits of a good software developer? What are they like in the workplace? What would you as a co-worker think of this person?
> I think a good software developer is a person open to feedback and willing to try something knew. They are a person that wants to communicate clearly and with respect. They are someone I want to go to if I have a problem because they have trained their minds to think through a situation in various ways.


2. What are the habits that this person demonstrates to embody the identity of a software developer?
> I believe that this person would have habits that speak to them as a developer. Meaning, every developer thinks through problems in different ways so whatever habits they hold might reflect how they think through a problem. If they have a habit of list forming, then maybe they are a very organized type of software developer. If they have a habit of creating tons of sticky notes, maybe they are the type of software developer that can relax into the chaos of something unknown. Or maybe the habit of list forming and relaxing into unknowns and the chaos are all habits this type of person would demonstrate.


3. Who do you want to be as a software developer? What kind of behaviors do you already have in place to be that person? What behaviors would you need to put into place? How will you do that?
> I am an organized person. I am a task driven person. I am the type of developer that creates lists and pseudocode before I can do much of coding. I want to improve upon the behavior of reacting to unknown things or new things. I want to gain the habit of being able to look at a piece of code and not immediately freeze up. I want to also improve upon the habit of asking for help rather than trying to be the lone wolf in every occasion. I think the last two will take repetition the most. The repetition of breathing calmly, maybe providing auditory or visual stimulus that can help calm me when I encounter the unknown. For the habit of asking for help, I want to change my language from "I should ask for help" to "I will ask for help" to start creating actionable language. Then, every time I ask for help, I use cute emojis in the message (because they make me happy) or do a dance to celebrate the fact that I finally asked for help.


##Working on the 1st Law of Behavior Change: Make it Obvious

Bring self-awareness to your current habits by making a Habits Scorecard. Make a list of your daily habits (examples: wake up, turn off alarm, check phone, etc.) as a way to bring awareness to what you do. Then, decide how effective that habit is for you and your goal of becoming a software developer. Put a + next to habits that are effective; put a - next to habits that are not effective; put a = next to habits that are neutral.
> Wake up & do yoga
> Eat Breakfast with family
> read a book
> Self-study
> Exercise +
> Meeting/self-study
> lunch/snack +
> lessons
> -navigate away from page to web browser -
> -drink water +
> -take breaks +
> -mobility exercises +
> -respond to messages during lessons -
> -look at message tab in zoom, respond to those non-technical messages -
> eat lunch/snack
> play guitar
> eat dinner with family
> self-study/group work
> bed time prep +++
> -call partner & talk
> -put phone in bathroom
> -wash face
> -brush & floss teeth


Pick 1 new habit you’d like to build and create an implementation intention following this template: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].” Then, stack the habit onto something you already do: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” (Hint: make this highly specific and immediately actionable)
> I will close & sign off from my computer & coding at 9:30pm every week day. After I close my computer, I will then continue my established habit of bedtime prep.


1. Design your environment for success: what changes could you make in your space to better implement your habit? How could you remove any triggers for bad habits? How will you implement these changes?
> An alarm reminding me to prepare for bed in 30 minutes. Being explicit with my partners & group members that I am unavailable after 9:30. Telling my partner to call me/expect a call from me at 9:35 every night to make sure that I am off the computer and preparing for bed.  


2. Respond after a few days of this implementation: What are your results? How do you feel about this method? How will you move forward with this habit?
> Asking my partner to keep me accountable is a powerful motivator! He called me at nine the other day and when I still wasn't off the computer, he called me on it. It was great to get a decent night's sleep. We talked over the best way to do it and decided that I would text him the time I want to go to sleep tonight, and he would call me a half hour before that time so I can get my brain to shut down. I like planning, so by saying ahead of time, in the morning, it's really helpful for me, too.
