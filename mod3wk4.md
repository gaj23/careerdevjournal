# Mod 3 Week 4

### Prepare for Job Shadow: AEIOU
1. Activities: what questions do you have about the activities that a software developer does on a daily basis?

- On average, how many hours during a work day are your fingers on the keyboard?

- Outside of coding, what other responsibilities do devs have?

- Are there groups? Hobbies or identity based groups.

2. Environment: what questions do you have about the overall environment and culture of this workplace?

- Do you find your company to be active in the community?

- How does Ibotta support remote work? Running zoom calls? Fairly scheduled?

- Has Ibotta announced a plan going forward for 2021?

- Is there structured space for learning/mentorship?

3. Interactions: what questions do you have about the team at this company? What do you hope to see in your interactions during the shadow?

- How clear is the delineation of work responsibilities on your team?

- What was your interview process like?

- How are teams broken down? What's the hierarchy like?

- What are the team sizes?

- How often do you get to interact with devs not on your team? How often do you interact with non-devs?

4. Objects: what questions do you have about the code or the product?

- How have new technologies been introduced? What's Ibotta's process to approve new libraries or framework integrations?  

- What's one of your favorite problems that you've encountered so far?

- How does a team handle bugs?

- When's a time you made a mistake? How did your team respond? Your manager? Yourself?

5. Users: what questions do you have about how the company interacts with their users?

- Ibotta mentions millennials specifically on their landing page. How does the code, though, encourage users from various ages?

- How has ibotta grown to protect their users through cybersecurity?

- The highlighting function when you're on a website, was that something originally in the system or something that was developed over time?

- What's an example of a time ibotta responded to user feedback and how did the software development team contribute to that?

### On the Job Notes
- Engineers make their own tickets and assign themselves tickets! I loved this.
- Managers are very intentional about asking devs to study, especially new devs
- `console.table({thingToSee: 'See the thing very obviously!'})`
- Just know typescript, sorta, is a good idea.
- They have a slack thread where internal users provide feedback (‘You are your own worst critique’ scenario)
- (Integration)[https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests] testing is that sweet spot with FE testing.

### After the Job Shadow
1. Activities: what was engaging to the person/people you shadowed?
- Travis was willing to take his time going through unfamiliar code and consider our comments and questions seriously. At no point did I feel as if he was talking above me or down to me.

2. Environment: what did you notice about how they talked about the culture and environment of this company?
- I noticed that they spoke about culture first (when looking at companies) and encouraging exploration (with their own  teams and otherwise).

3. Interactions: what did you notice about your interactions with this person/people?
- I was give very specific examples! They all followed the STAR method, either implicitly or explicitly.

4. Objects: what did you learn about their approach to code and/or product development?
- Travis was excited to try new things and that he was allowed to choose his own adventure in regards to ticket items. I thought this fostered a better connection with the product.

5. Users: what did you learn about their approach to their users?
- They are their own worst critiques! Ibotta has a place where internal users can make notes of UI/UX wins or challenges.

6. What are your main takeaways from the shadow? How will you use this information to help you with your job search strategy?
- Ask about the engineering managers & how they create space for learning environments.
- Who makes decisions in regards to introducing new tech?
- DO I CARE ABOUT WHAT THE PRODUCT IS?

I think that I came across that last point a few times in the job search and I want to lean into that more. git

### Interview Prep:
1. Pick a successful project and write about it with the STAR method (What was the situation/scenario of the project? What was the task/target of the project? What action steps did you take? What were the results?):

My project partner and I created a responsive web app that called upon a RESTful API to display various movies, their descriptions, and their ratings. Utilizing React, Router, and Cypress, we ensured that the user had a fluid experience no matter their screen size. What made this project successful, despite time zone differences, was our willingness to communicate. We held a nightly digest before I signed off. We talked about where we were in the project, what he was going to work on tonight, and what I was going to work on in the morning. That allowed for us to work asynchronously. For example, during the testing phase, Richard would complete a set of tests, message me the branch he was working off of before he went to bed, and then in the morning, I would checkin to his branch to create another and continuing building out our tests. We followed this pattern and finished MVP 3 days in advanced. Thus, when our problem with deployment occurred, we had plenty of time to address said problem.

2. Write about a time you failed and what you learned from that experience:

I transferred to a new elementary school after 2 years working in Japan. Previously, I managed class room activities, curriculum direction, and any additional prepwork. I was the main foreign language teacher that came into a classroom and the homeroom teacher handed it off to me. I continued performing the same responsibilities as I did previously, however, I made the mistake of assuming my responsibilities. My assumption, that this pattern would continue, resulted some awkward conversations that cumulated to having be sit down by the principal so that I could understand my new position. It was two months of teacher and I unsure of how to behave in the classroom and who's responsibilities were who's. Because of this, that also meant classes could have been more effective and student learning better if this communication came first. I learned that curbing my excitement and enthusiasm to make space for this initial communication is what created a successful start to the three following years.  

3. Write about how you’ve approached working with a team using a specific example:

During a project, I was moving cross country and experienced car trouble that resulted in the unexpected purchase of a new car. During this time, I communicated with my team via text of what I was able and unable to do at the time. In turn, my teammates ensure I was also updated on what they were working on. This exemplifies what I care about most when working on a team: communication. When a piece of code proves to be tricker than expected, I reach out or I offer my help. When I am ready to move on to something else or if I discover a bug, I communicate that. I have seen that my willingness to communicate makes it easier for others to reach out as well.

4. What other stories will you prepare to share?

- My group project in which I learned that respecting a project mate's code and work was more important than completing a piece of code in a way I felt was more empathetic and clean.

- My solo project that I asked for an extension on because a little more time goes a long way.

> Do some research into your top companies’ tech stacks; what do you already know? What can you compare to your own learning? What do you need to learn more about?

`shethinx.com`
- I know webpack
- I know they use the support from shopify to create their site, something I'm familiar with.
- I don't know anything about AngularJS

`allaboutbirds.org`
- They use react & node.js & express!
- They also use AngularJS and PHP which I'm unfamiliar with.
- They integrate WordPress for their blogging. 

> Using this [interview prep resource doc](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/resources/interview_prep_resources.md), pick out at least 3 resources you will use to prepare for interviews as well as 3 behavioral questions you could practice:

##### Resources to Use
- Ian's mailing list
- Pramp
- Not on the list but what I've been recommended to use: __Cracking the Coding Interview__

##### Behavioral questions
1. What are you looking for in a company? Why would you want to work here?
2. Tell me about a time you had competing priorities or worked on multiple projects at once. How did you manage to make or miss the deadlines? What did you learn from that experience?
3. Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?
