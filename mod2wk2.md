# Mod 2 Week 2

1. Assess your habits from week 1: how did you spend your time this past week? What was effective in your habits? What could be more effective? What steps will you take to make that happen?  
> Things seem to be going really well! I've gotten off the PC by 9. I've exercised in some capacity everyday. I've taken the time to pre-teach over the weekend (This is probably the key things that's really helped all my other weekly habits to occur).


2. Write a draft of your professional story here as 1-2 paragraphs. Focus on answering the questions who are you, why are you here, and whatâ€™s next? Consider how to talk about your motives and values, the turning points that led to your career change, and what you envision for yourself going forward.  
> I started teaching English as a Foreign language to new members of my community. I wanted to reach more people, so I moved to Japan. But to do what I love, and to do it effectively, I needed to teach myself Japanese. I improved my relationships with coworkers and directed 4 district wide teacher training events. It became obvious, though, that teaching English as a foreign language in Japan had reached a point where I was stunted in the amount of people I could connect and who I was connecting with.
> Software development is the optimal platform for this. It's incredibly flexible with powerful potential. I want to continue pursuing my passion of connecting people. Are the apps accessible across platforms and for various people? Can my mother understand how to use this app or would she need to asked for my help? I want to bring these questions into my work and on my team.
