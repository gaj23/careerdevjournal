# Mod 3 Week 3

### Back to your resume and cover letter youâ€™ve been working on:
> What other next steps do you want to take to make these two components stronger?

- [ ] Get mentor feedback
Both my mentors are employed and I think can offer me great, great advice on how to highlight my skill sets.

### Outreach Brainstorming:
> Either explore the company you wrote a cover letter for or find a new company to explore this week; Go to their company LinkedIn page and start to explore the employees. Who are a couple people you could reach out to? Why?

A cohort mate sent a job description from github about an Accessibility team. I realized that once of the first graduates from Turing is a senior developer at github! Additionally, I noticed some alumni from my alma mater also worked there.

### Finalize Your Plan:
> Who have you decided to reach out to? Why that person? How will you contact them? What do you want to talk to them about? How will you follow up?

I feel as if my first point of contact should be Tess Griffin, the Turing grad, is the best. I will contact them on LinkedIn first, then a follow up with slack. I want to know about their career path since graduation and understand their choices in moving between companies and then staying with one these last three years.

### Execute your plan:
> Reach out to your contact THIS WEEK. If possible, reach out to more than one person OR find a meetup to attend also. What happened? What did you learn about the company? What other next steps should you take for pursuing this company? Be sure to update this in Huntr.
