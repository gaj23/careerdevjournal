# Mod 2 Week 3

1. Assess your habits from week 2: how did you spend your time this past week? What was effective in your habits? What could be more effective? What steps will you take to make that happen?
> I was off the computer after 9! Every day! My partner was great about letting me go and respecting my time during our project together. I only hope that in other groups, I will have members who respect my time as she did.

2. Reflect on how you’ve spent your time so far at Turing to gauge your engagement and energy:

- When have you been excited, focused, and enjoyed your work? When have you felt bored, restless, or unhappy? When do you feel energized in your work? When is your energy drained?

> I'm excited and focused when it comes to lessons about design and accessibility. I enjoyed DOM manipulation and user interaction. I get bored or restless when we "peel" the layers back and go more into the computer science of development. I felt drained and frustrated when cohort members weren't able to translate what they were doing into layman's terms. I loved working on respectful teams on a deliverable.

3. Setting up habits and routines to make time for the job search this module:
- Block out time on your calendar this week to work on your job search. When will you make this happen? How will you hold yourself accountable to this? What activities will you focus on during this time this week? What outcomes do you hope to reach by the end of this week because of these activities?
> I decided to make this happen the day that my project was due and on Friday. Days I know that lessons will be less and I will have more free time. Additionally, on Thursday, there was pre-scheduled out time for PD. I took advantage of that. Additionally, I asked to meet with another cohort memeber who I knew was struggling with keep up with PD to keep me accountable to work during that time. I hope to focus on giving and receiving endorsements. Especially with contacts outside of Turing or not in my FE cohort. I hope to have reached 100 contacts on LinkedIn by the end of Sunday.  

- Applying wayfinding to using job search resources
- Go through the resources listed here and explore [2-3 tools](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/resources/finding_opportunities.md). List what you looked at here:
> I looked at the women in tech listing, the start ups, as well as the LGBTQ+ resources. I was surprised not to see any resources about volunteering as a way to get more practice and make connections, though. For example catchafire.

4. Apply wayfinding: of what you looked at, what did you discover that aligns with your vision? If it didn’t align with your vision, what will you try next? Decide what tools to bookmark to explore later.
> I did not like Owlr. Why is it suggested? You can access minimum information as a free user. In the past, I've used LinkedIn, Indeed, and glassdoor to try to get an understand of a companies culure and found more success there. I was unimpressed with Owlr and rather than trying to force myself to use it, I moved on. I spent more time exploring Catch A Fire to see what type of companies are posting volunteer opportunities there.
> I signed up to receive JavaScript weekly, though I am unsure if I'll actually look through it. But I'm grateful that it's only once a week and not daily. I dislike daily emails.
> I'm excited about the events page in out in tech! I want to go to the Jan 11 event about resumes.
> This Dot is wicked. I like how you have to apply and be vetted. It's a challenge and helps solidify my desire to be a part of a program that focuses on mentorship, something I'm passionate about.
> I liked how Hatchways assess users as well, in regards to their abilities. It tells me companies that use this site know the caliber of people they want working on their teams.
> I applied to remoteWomen as well as Tech ladies.
> Finally, after browsing more on PowerToFly, I created an account. I like the design and UX and thus wanted to use it! what can I say, I'm a FE developer at heart with a UX/UI focus.

5. Find a job posting that aligns with your vision. What’s the posting? How does it align with what you’re looking for? Add it to your Huntr.
> I recently learned about UX Research as a job. With my background in Psychology and interests in data driven actions, I was pleased to find a job that finally spoke to me. About the long term impact, the work I would be doing, and something that would apply to my experiences. I found a posting for an apprenticeship in Boston. Well, possibly remote, too. I realize that it's probably finished (it was posted over a month ago), but it was hopeful to know that companies are actively seeking people to fill these positions. I also saw a posting for a senior UX researcher, which tells me there's movement for this type a career. Something that I didn't have in my previous career.

6. What next steps will you take to explore that opportunity and find contacts? Add that information to your Huntr card.
> My main thing at this point, then, would to be take advantage of all the events hosted by Turing's own JCS and then events held by places like Tech Ladies, Women Who Code, and Out In Tech. These events will help me be aware of the community as a whole and hopefully connect with others as well.
