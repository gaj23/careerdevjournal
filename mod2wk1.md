# Mod 2 Week 1

1. Reflect on your habits from last module. What behaviors and activities were helpful for you? What activities and behaviors could be more effective for you? What processes would you like to try differently this module to become more effective at your work and as a software developer?

- Weekend preteaching. I can't keep up with everything during the week, but taking the time on the weekend to do a bunch of preteaching is the most helpful for me. Setting an overall work time is best for me. For example: today, I will work four hours outside of class/scheduled time. And from there breaking down my day is more helpful than saying, I'll work a half hour, take a break, ect.

2. Setting intentions for this module: who do I want to be this module? What specific habits would help me get there? How are those habits tied to the identity of a software developer?

- I want to be a focused Software Developer. Saying "no" or being more strict about family/partner time will be incredibly important for this. That means only taking an hour for breakfast. An hour and a half for dinner. An hour for exercising. And being very, very intentional of my timing. More so than I was in mod1, especially on the weekends.

3. Incorporate temptation bundling to create a new habit by using [this template](https://jamesclear.com/temptation-bundling):

- After breakfast, I will review previous day's notes for 15 minutes.
- After reviewing previous day's notes for 15 minutes, I will google questions I still have and try to code the thing I don't understand for 15 minutes.

4. How to enjoy “hard” habits: Reframe your habits to consider their benefits rather than their drawbacks; name 3 habits that you have to do and explain the benefits of them. How do they further your goals longterm? How will they add to your processes as a successful developer? At the end of the day, how do they add to your life?

I have to do:
- review; building blocks are important for a reason. Having a solid understand of the basics will create an overall sound and stable code because I feel confident in what I'm doing. Reviewing is less about relearning, but rather reminding myself that there are things I know that I didn't know and to help build a base of confidence.
- google shit I don't know; I know. I know. We're told to do this all the time, but, I don't feel confident, so I don't google, because I don't trust myself to google the right thing so I lock up! Rather than that, I can get lost in the rabit hole of google for a few minutes at a time so that I can start to trust my own skills.
- try the scary stuff, I don't always consider myself "strong" or "smart" so I avoid the hard things and try the things that are within my reach or I consider within my reach. In reality, though, the scary stuff might/is in my reach! I've shown myself already that I have the abilities and I just need to keep applying that in small increments to everything else as well.

5. Environment design (optional 5-min. additional reading: [Motivation is Overvalued. Environment Often Matters More](https://jamesclear.com/power-of-environment)): how does your environment set-up currently help you with your habits? How could it be improved to make it easier for you to follow through on your habits?

- I have a dedicated workspace. It's in a little corner in my room that prevents distractions (ie, a window). I close my door during lessons/work time. I think something that I really could use is making sure that my calendar is more updated/purposefully scheduled out. It takes time to do it, but creating those visual cues are the first tiny start to creating my habits outlined above.

6. “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” Read this [4-min article](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating) on how to stop procrastinating. Apply the 2-minute rule to reframe 2-3 of your habits by scaling them down into the 2-minute version. How does this reframing help you think about shaping your new identity as a software developer?

- After breakfast, I skim the notes from the day before for 2 minutes.
- After I skim the notes from the day before, then I skim google results of examples of those topics for 2 minutes.

- Reframing these things breaks it into small manageable chunks! Coding is all about the small, manageable chunks!
