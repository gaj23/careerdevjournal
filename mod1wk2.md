# Power of self-reflection
1. What is challenging about self-reflection?
> Self-reflection is challenging because you have to be honest to yourself and honesty can be incredibly painful. Our human psyches have been evolutionally designed to protect our egos. When we have to question and put into perspective our own thoughts, it takes effort. That effort is incredibly difficult to muster up and admit to yourself that yes, you need to self-reflect to help yourself.
2. How can you continue to build the habit of self-reflection at Turing?
> Journaling is the obvious one. I would say asking yourself a question as to why you're doing what your doing, in the moment, is another strategy, as well. This strategy takes enormous amount of effort and training to consistently apply.

## Social identity mapping
First, create you own social identity map on a piece of paper:

- Outer ring: write words that describe your given identity
- Middle ring: list aspects of your chosen identity
- Center: write your core attributes—traits, behaviors, beliefs, values, characteristics, and skills that you think make you unique as an individual. Select things that are enduring and key to who you are.  

After you complete your map:
- Underline the items that are important to you
- Put a + beside the items that you believe clearly demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry
- Put a - beside the items that you believe do not demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry
- Put a ? beside the items that you’re unsure how they could show your ability to contribute to the tech industry
- Reflect:
- >  I notice that two things that are incredibly important to me in the "given" ring (a sister and a Pittsburgher) are things I'm not sure how they could impact my interaction with the tech industry. It bothers me a little that I do not have an answer how I can apply these important things to my worklife as well.

1. What does your social identity tell you about what you already bring to the tech industry?
> Being white, my voice is already elevated in the tech industry, despite also being a woman. I'm put in a position of power that will allow me to empower others who are not given the same culturally/racially assigned power that exists in America. My core value of passion can directly apply to whatever dev project I am working on *if I believe in the project.*  
2. What would it look like for some of your minuses or question marks to turn into pluses? In other words, how could some of these traits be assets for the tech industry?
> I want to use my knowledge of always working in a group (aka with my siblings) to translate into what it's like working on a tech team and managing those personalities and perspectives. Also, my Pittsburgher, country living background does not reflect the same polished image of major metropolises or more liberal leaning states. I think this, though, is a huge advantage so that products can access more people.  

## Values mapping
Pull out 5 values for each bullet below from this list:

Always valued:
- Mental Stimulation
- Family
- Growth
- Self-discipline
- Respect for people

Often valued:
- Environment
- Sincerity
- Humility
- Joy
- Efficiency

Sometimes valued:
- Work Alone
- Truth
- Loyalty
- Pride
- Connection

Seldom valued:
- Success
- Tranquility
- Competition
- Aesthetics
- Legacy

Reflect:
> When reading through the ones I pulled out from the list, I find myself asking, what's the different between pride and success? Obviously, because I put them in different areas, I delineate between the two. But I struggle to articulate the difference.

1. What do these values tell you about yourself?
> I found that limiting my always valued to just five was difficult. Most of the values listed in "often" (with the exception of efficiency) I say I *always* value. I realized that my thinking is very much split between things I care about and things I just don't. The sometimes valued list? Yeah, even those I don't really care about. There's a bit of gray area, but not much, in terms of my values.


## Workview & Lifeview  
1. Summarize what good, worthwhile work means to you (Tip: this is NOT about what work you want to do but about why work matters to you):
> Work that allows me space to take care of myself as much as it allows me to take care of others. Work that is actionable and creates changes in a reasonable timeframe. Work that recognizes achievements in many ways, especially work that is not necessarily defined in monetary ways. Work that allows me to learn from others and teach others in the workspace itself and through community outreach.

2. Lifeview: summarize what you value in life; what matters to you?
  > Time with family and those I love is incredibly important to me. My biggest struggle so far in Turing is having to put this investment first, before time with them. I like learning new things and have passions that I want to pursue outside of work life/whatever area I end up working in. I do not believe that work is life or that life is work. I think that I can be passionate about my work, but also be able to put it away when its time to. Along with learning new things, I want to encourage others to learn new things, too. I want to engage with others about their passions & improve our human existence for the long term.

 - Where do your views on work and life complement each other?
  - > Wanting to have space for time with family.

 - Where do they clash?
  - > ...they don't? I mean, right now they certainly feel as if they don't. I guess I've watched how people dedicate so much of themselves to work life that outside of work, they have no definition of who they are. I think that is a fear I have and something I actively try to build away from.

 - Does one drive the other? How?
  - > My life view drives my work life. How I want to live my life impacts how I view my work life, how I view work itself, and how I want to interact with work.
