1. When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?  
> Post Its. When I challenged myself to "win" [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/), my mentor for that year gave me some tips. He told me to break down the 50,000 words needed to "win" into 1,000 chunks and make a visual in whatever way worked best for me. Taking a post it, I would write a number, put it on my wall, increment it by one and loop through the process until I had reached 50. Day by day, as I would surpass those 1,000 word benchmarks, I would take down a post it, crumple it up and look at my wall of numbers and think to myself, "Yes, I am making progress even if I don't feel like my writing is going anywhere." Those visuals I created (via post its, lists in my agenda book, datapoints in excel), helped me reach my goals of becoming a Nanowrimo Winner, fluent in Japanese, and a Marathoner. They helped me maintain motivation--even if the motivation was simply crossing it off on my list or pulling it off my wall because I hate clutter. That simplest of motivations is where I am starting with as I begin my journey at Turing. That little thing of copy and pasting the questions I need to answer for my first career development journaling? Done! Look at that. I'm on a roll.  

2. As you start this new career, what is one of your strengths and how do you know?  
> My willingness to try familiar techniques in a new environment will be my greatest asset. I transferred skills and habits from high school to university without conscious effort. Through university, I put habits through rigorous tests: am I actually more productive waking up early in the morning? Long stints or short sprints? Do I work better meeting up with classmates to study or should I really be doing this on my own? In preparation for moving to Japan, I knew then what I needed to succeed. It took some trial and error, yes, but I applied what worked in the past to see if it could be applied again. What works for me as a software developer will also undergo some trial and error. Will waking up early rather than staying up late to work still be a viable solution for me as I begin my journey at Turing and into software development? I don’t know. Let’s find out.  
 
3. Describe how you work best (conditions, environment, preferences, etc.):  
> I do my best work without music, in a clean, organized environment with the door closed, and my phone on do not disturb. I like having a specific start and finish time more than having accomplished tasks as my end goal. I know eating right and exercising are essential for my work. That I rather get up and leave in the middle of something I feel confident I can finish later rather than trying to bang out as much as possible and exhausting myself. I’m steady and maybe a bit slow considering my marathon training habits. I rather work up to something over the long run than just jumping right into it. Based on how I studied for my Japanese Language Proficiency Tests, I know that the sooner I start in the day, the better. I’m a morning worker, through and through. Afternoons are when I like to revise, edit, catch up, and prepare for the next morning.  

4. As you start this new career, what is your greatest area of improvement when it comes to your professional skills?  
> I am changing into a career in which I have no knowledge and little technical confidence. I am changing from a career in which I am highly educated, experienced, and have a plethora of technical confidence. I could see the ceiling in my last job. The steps there are clear and defined and frustrating. Here I am, now, submitting myself to years of humility in something vastly complex and varied. I will want to fall back on non-technical language to hide as many mistakes as possible. I will shy away from terms that my dyslexic mind struggles to keep straight because I’ll be afraid of looking less professional than I actually am. But I don’t *want* to do those things. I aim to push myself to improve in my technical communication despite the fact that I will stutter and flip two labels for a concept. 

5. How will developing a deeper understanding of your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?  
> Developing an understanding of my working preferences and strengths will benefit me as a software developer by allowing me to approach a problem in a specific way. It allows me to create a unique lens in which to view a problem and find its solution. This includes when working with a team. Us all having different strengths and *knowing* what those strengths are means we delegate work in an efficient manner. Additionally, all these different ways of problem solving will create a well-rounded and inclusive solution.   

6. Describe the vision you currently have for your career after Turing:  
>The first job won’t be great. Maybe even the second. I’ll work thrice-adjacent to my "ideal" position (TBD) until years go by. I wish I could say I have it planned out. But I don’t. I know that I like working with people. That I like knowing the products I’m selling or services I’m providing somehow positively impact someone’s life. Companies like *Duolingo* or *Planned Parenthood* or *Terracycling* or *Translators without Borders* all contribute to causes that I am passionate about. I like the idea of creating an app that can help me and others who struggle with eczema make the right decisions when buying beauty products. And maybe things aren’t great six months out of Turing. Maybe they are adjacent to what-I-really-want, but I’m more than okay with that because I will be problem solving and using the combined power of my new skills with my honed past skills.
