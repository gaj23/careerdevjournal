# Mod 1 Week 4  

##Habits Reflection:
- How have you seen yourself become more aware of your habits? Have you tried implementing anything new? What have the results been?  
> I've been better about navigating away from zoom when lessons are on or engaging in conversations in chat that can distract from the lesson at hand. I'm still struggling to implement the bed time, though, because there never seems to be enough time! My partner is very helpful, though. He is a huge motivator and reminder to me that I need to keep on taking care of my body through this program. A habit that I've decided to remove, though, is the logging of food. It creates an additional thing to do. And frankly, I don't want to prioritize it right now!

## Start Where You Are (Empathize with the user – you)
###Health: how you answer “how are you”; intersection of physical, mental, and emotional health
- How would you rate your overall health on a scale of 1-5? How do you currently make time for activities associated with your health? What is a small change you could make here to readjust your health ratings?
> 3. I feel like I make time for healthy things, but those healthy things are also holding me back. (Like, is it really necessary that I exercise more than an hour a day?! NO!). Thus, what I'm doing to be "healthy" is in fact, damaging. I think limiting my exercise to less than an hour a day is incredibly important and then also not recording my food intake, at this point, is more effort I'm putting for towards other things that don't actually help me stay mentally or physically healthy.

### Work: what you do
- Make a short list of all the ways you work right now; How much value do each of those things bring to your life? How are those activities purposeful for you?
> I have no idea how to answer this question. What is work? How is it being defined because at this point, I consider everything I'm doing studying not working. If I was to equate studying with working, then I would say that's a majority of what I do. Browsing the internet for solutions. Asking for help of my mentors or rocks. Attending study halls with my cohort. These things hold a lot of purpose for me because they are building me up to be as successful as possible in the future.

### Play: what brings you joy?
- Think about joy just for the pure sake of doing it; everyone benefits from this kind of play
- What activities do you do that bring you joy throughout an average week? In what ways could you make a small change to bring more joy into your life?
>Playing the guitar daily. I do love it. It's a nice way to do something different and takes me away from everything else. Reading. Similar to the guitar, reading takes me out of my mind and puts me somewhere else. These types of things help me relax and allow my brain time to rest. I think by incorporating my guitar practice time into my lunch time would help create a much needed break in the middle of the day. (I already have established the habit of reading at breakfast.)

### Love: sense of connection
- who are the people who matter in your life and how is love flowing to and from you and them?
- How does love currently show up in your life? How do you show love to others right now? What adjustments would you like to make in this area?
> Love is the support my family and my partner are showing me at this time. Their willingness to adjust to my schedule. At this time, I'm working to take a moment with them and to purposefully schedule time with them. This time allows me to get away from the code and see the bigger picture of what's around me, too.


- Looking back at the 4 areas, do any problems emerge that you want to begin designing solutions for?
> I think the health is imposing more problems then help. I love my family so much that I feel so guilty when I spend time away from them. But then I also feel guilty when I'm not with them. I want to really work on reminding myself that by dedicating my time to them and then dedicating time to my code are equally important and I can be honest about that rather than letting the guilt cloud my time with them or with the code.

##Define your needs, problems, and insights:
- Based on what you wrote about above and your group conversation, what problems have you identified that you’d like to design solutions for? What do you already about what you want for your career? What do you still need to find out? Who or what do you want to grow into by the end of the Turing program?
> I need a respect for boundaries. I want to work in a position that will be respectful of my time and how we negotiate to manage it. I need to find out if that's a legitimate thing. Also, how to argue for that in a contract or make it clear to the team I'm working with. I want to grow into that all important communication portion of saying, "I'll give you this much of my time, please respect that" even if extenuating circumstances occur.

##Ideate – challenge assumptions
- When you discussed software developers with your small group on Monday, what assumptions came up about what software developers actually do? What steps could you take to challenge those assumptions and find more facts to answer the question of what developers do? In addition to what a typical software developer life could look like, what do you want yours to include?
> Nothing but anything! Talking with different people in the field is incredibly important to understand the composition of the field. I want my life to include the ability to have areas of growth and for my overall growth to be encouraged: not task-based growth.

##Prototype – start creating solutions
- What is the basic threshold that your new career must meet after Turing? What would you hope WILL NOT happen in your future after Turing? What is your absolute, no-holds-barred, ideal dream for your future after Turing?
> My basic threshold is this: remote, but based locally with the potential of attending certain collaboration events; respectful of boundaries, I actually want the 9-5 thanks; a living wage based on the area of living; In my future after Turing, I would like to take a break from a job or position that causes me to be drained emotionally and one that has no other solutions besides "we just need more of your time" to solve a problem. My dream position would be with a team, in a position just below the manager so that I can still create and solve problems. I want to work in a position that has a clearly defined goals and can work towards those goals & result in a product for users. Remote? Yeah, sure! Partially at least would be great, or not judgmental if I decide to work from a camper.

##Test –- solutions
- Based on this week of reflections, write out your initial vision statement for your career:
> I want to wake up, have time to spend on myself and with my family, and look forward to the challenges I'm going to experience at work. I want to engage with the wider team of developers and developer adjacent coworkers to effectively solve problems the users are experiences. I'm able to have flexibility and security in my job. Then, when it's time to go home, I want to go home. To set the work down and know that I won't be penalized for wishing to do so either. My boundaries are respected. I want to enjoy my job, but I don't want it to be my life.
