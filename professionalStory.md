I went to school to be a doctor, but preferred volunteering to teach new members of the Pittsburgh community English as a Foreign Language. Each person was at a different level and had different needs that I responded to accordingly. I connected people with their surroundings and other members of the community. Being a part of that bigger picture influenced my decision to work aboard in Japan even though I didn't speak Japanese. To foster a better working relationship with my Japanese co-workers, I taught and challenged myself to assessment tests. Teaching elementary students English and about the wider cultures outside of their island home fulfilled my passion to bring our world together for a time.

- something here about wider cultures & interconnections
- small, concentrated impact, but the personal growth was also stunted
- wanted to continue to make meaningful impacts that allowed personal growth
- flexibility to work in large fields
- Questions I want to answer here
- team
- be at a company that values meaningful impacts, flexible and open to change




I went to work in Japan before I learned Japanese. I prepared for my job as an English as a Foreign Language teacher. I taught new members of the Pittsburgh Community and worked as a TA in the English department. I connected people, to their surroundings, to others, to new things. I loved it. And to do what I love more effectively, I taught myself Japanese. Work flourished. I improved my relationships with coworkers, was called on to lead Japanese teacher training events, and was used as a model for how ELF was to be conducted at the elementary school level.  
It became obvious after five years, though, that teaching English as a foreign language in Japan reached a point where I was stunted in the amount of people I could connect and who I was connecting with.  
I looked into different avenues: communication, NGO, community development. All felt familiar, though. I saw the line from where I would start and where I would end. I knew if I pursued those professions, in another five years time I would be back doubting myself.
How can I put myself into a flexible and dynamic profession that provides me with the tools to connect people?
Software development, I concluded. It's incredibly flexible with powerful potential. I want to continue pursuing my passion of connecting people. Are the apps accessible across platforms and for various people? Can my mother understand how to use this app or would she need to asked for my help? I want to bring these questions into my work and on my team.
