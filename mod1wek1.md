1. Describe one of your strengths
 * What is something you have learned to do well (list a skill)?
> I can organize.
* What is something you know about (list some knowledge/expertise you have)?
> I know how to manage my time.
* What is something you have a natural ability to do well (list a talent)?
> I am spatially aware.
How could you combine these to describe a specific strength?
> Project Management

2. Read through your Top 4 results from Pairin
* In your own words, what do these top 4 qualities tell you about yourself?
> They told me things I intrinsically understood about myself.
* Do they resonate with you? Why/why not?
> I know my optimistic thinking style has allowed me to problem solve with the confidence that I __eventually__ would get to the answer. A dream of mine is to solve major problems, but the amount of competitive nature that exists in some people I struggle to understand as a motivator. I never considered it under the label of "achiever", though. Additionally, I like to ask questions and puzzle through answers to acknowledge I don't have all the correct solutions, but that sometimes doesn't matter.
* How do they relate to the strength you wrote about in Prompt #1?
> My strength of project management, written in Prompt #1, is something that applies to all of my top Pairin qualities. You can't do project management if you don't have that point of view that the work will get done, no matter what. You have to remain calm, reasonable, and orientated to the big picture. I thrive knowing I am completing a major project, as indicated by my Ace Achiever driver. In project management, because of my highest EQ being self confidence, I tend to lead and manage projects. However, because I believe of the importance of knowledge and knowing various points of views, I believe this also can contribute to my strength of project management.


3. Challenges with strengths
* What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?
> I see myself performing skills, utilizing talents, and sharing my knowledge as a way to meet a goal. But whatever combination of things I use, I struggle to recognize those as strengths. I do think having the Pairin results and other analytical studies help give me more definitive, "Yes, you're good at the thing that you thought you were". However, I also know that some of these challenges, the lack of self recognition, will fade the more and more I work with others and come to understand my place in a a community.
* Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?
> I think I overuse my conversation strength to the point of where rather than just letting others talk without commentary, I comment on everything, force people to extrapolate half formed ideas they may not be prepared or willing to think through at the moment of the question. Thus, I want to utilize the other part of my conversation strength, the part that makes me listen more and hear more of what someone is saying rather than commenting and including my own perspective. I think by imposing a five to ten second rule where I make myself wait in zoom calls before speaking is a powerful way to ensure I practice and tighten up this strength of mine.


4. Strengths in action
* Write 1-2 sentences describing how you like to work (i.e., Do you pre-plan? Do you talk through your ideas first? Do you work better with deadlines? How do you stay organized?)
> I need to know the deadlines first. Then working backwards, I make a plan for when things need to get done. I would then flesh out the bare bones more, edit said plan and start executing said plan.
* How could you describe these working preferences to your project teammates? Your mentor? Your instructors?
>
* What would you need to be aware of when working with people who have different strengths from you?
> Silences. I struggle with silence in zoom calls often, but others need that time to formulate ideas and by not leaning into the silence, I might not be giving space for people to exercise their own strengths.
* How could your Pairin results help you better understand your everyday working preferences?
> 


5. Continued growth
* Is there any particular strength you’d like to sharpen while you’re at Turing? Any area you consider a weakness that you’d like to strengthen?
>
* What are some steps you could take here?
>
* How could you be aware of progress you’re making?
