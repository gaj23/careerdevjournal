# Mod 3 Intermission Reflection

1. Please list the top 3-5 industries and companies you'll pursue in your job search as of right now.

- Cornell Lab of Ornithology/e-bird/Merlin
- Audobon Society
- Duolingo
- Planned Parenthood/Women's Health focused
- Terracycling/Green living focus

2. Why did you pick the industries/companies that you listed above? How do they relate to the values and goals you have for yourself in your job search?

These industries reflect my passions: birds, language learning, women's health, and green living. I know that I want to work in a place where I'm surronded by people with the same values as me. In my social media interactions, I believe these places try to foster that. Additionally, when looking into their job opening, I saw job growth and opportunities at each place. Considering this was a major factor in leaving from my last job in Japan, I know it's incredible important for myself that I don't feel pigeonholed. 

3. How does your LinkedIn currently reflect your goals and industry interests? What changes will you need to make to your LinkedIn to better reflect these?

At this time, I think my LinkedIn reflect the bottom half of the listed companies and interests. Up until Turing, I considered myself unable to get jobs working with bird id apps. But now, I have and continue to develop those skills. As such, making sure that I'm following those different places, exploring who is who at these companies, and understanding the types of people I could talk with to gain that understanding would be beneficial for my future goals.
