1. Find a position or use a position youâ€™ve put on your Huntr board and write a cover letter for that position in a Google doc or gist. Reference these cover letter resources as well as the session to complete your cover letter.
> [My Cover Letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fnUgcv5wz9EwB3Fz6xuYZTlYpiNw2LDief7kiGRyroQ/edit?usp=sharing) for a Software Developer position with Cornell Lab of Ornithology (this position is no longer available)

2. Review your cover letter with a peer some time this week. What feedback did your partner give you? What next steps will you take to make your cover letter even stronger?

- I submitted my cover letter to two different peers. They both gave me various & different types of advice. I tried to find similarities in their advice and apply that. From there, I assessed their suggestions and decided whether that was not congruent to "my brand" or it was something I needed to address.
